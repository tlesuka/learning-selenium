# Automation Testing with Selenium and JavaScript

This is a learning project for starting with automation testing with Selenium and JavaScript.

Here is an unofficial guide how to get started and use this project.

## Getting Started

To start with this project you need to have installed either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. In this project, I used Yarn for installing packages and running tests.
