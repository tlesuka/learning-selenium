# Automation Testing with Selenium and JavaScript

This is a learning project for starting with automation testing with Selenium and JavaScript.

Here is an unofficial guide for setting up your environment to run UI automation tests using Selenium WebDriver and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.

In this project, I used [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for installing packages and running tests.

```sh
yarn install
```

Install the necessary dependencies for UI automation testing:

- selenium-webdriver - The official WebDriver bindings for JavaScript. It provides a convenient API for interacting with web browsers.
- chromedriver - WebDriver for Chrome browser. Ensure you have Chrome installed on your system.
- mocha - A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.

## Running Test

With your project set up and dependencies installed, you can now write and run UI automation tests using Selenium WebDriver and Mocha. Create your test scripts in a directory of your choice and execute them.

Tests can be run from the command line.

```sh
yarn run test
```
